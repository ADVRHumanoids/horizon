Welcome to Horizon's documentation!
===================================
Horizon is a framework for trajectory optimization and optimal control tailored to robotic systems.
It relies on direct methods to reduce an optimization problem into a NLP that can be solved using many state-of-the-art solvers.

Horizon is based on `CasADi <https://web.casadi.org/>`_, a tool for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation.
It uses `Pinocchio <https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio>`_ to smoothly integrate the robot model into the optimization problem.

Features
========
- complete **pipeline** from model aquisition to robot deployment 
- **intuitive** API allowing a quick setup of the optimization problem
- ease of configuration and highly *customizable*: integrators, transcription methods, solvers..
- support **state-of-the-art** non linear solvers + two custom solvers: ILQR and GNSQP

Install
=======
Two distributions are supported:

- *pip* package: ``pip install casadi_horizon``
- *conda* package: ``conda install horizon -c francesco_ruscelli``

Getting started
=======
Some examples demonstrating trajectory optimization for different robots are available.
Besides installing Horizon on your machine and running the examples, you can try out the framework in independent evinronments:

- on your browser, through *JupyterLab*: `horizon-web <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/FrancescoRuscelli/horizon-live/main?urlpath=lab/tree/index.ipynb>`_
- on your machine, through *Docker*.

* from `here <https://github.com/ADVRHumanoids/horizon/tree/devel/docker>`_, execute ``run.sh``

Videos
=======
A collection of clips demonstrating the capabilities of Horizon is gathered in the video below, where are gathered trajectory optimization demos with several robots: 
*Centauro*, *Spot* |reg|, *Kangaroo*, *TALOS*, a 7-DoF industrial manipulator and a prototype 2-DoF leg.
